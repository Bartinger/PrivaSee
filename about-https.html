     <h1>Who's this HTTPS and why does everyone want to connect with him?</h1>
      <h3>TL;DR</h3>
      HTTPS encrypts everything you do on the web, so a middleman (your ISP, etc) can't read it and laugh about the kitties you're looking at. This might not be so important for the average kitty-pic-collecting website, but becomes a serious problem if you're logging into a website (your password and / or account might get stolen!).

      As long as you're surfing at home, in a somewhat "secure" network, the risks of HTTP aren't too high. However, in a public network, for example one of a <a href="https://www.campus-party.eu/">convention with 10.000 participants</a>, there's a huge risk to lose control over your sensitive data!
